Using these assumptions, if you heat that water with the humidifier, you will spend a whopping $355 in electricity, versus just $81 in natural gas, to supply the same amount of heat to your air.

In practice, this means the HEV685W emitted more frequencies in the high mid-range that, though not technically much louder than other models, may seem louder (or at least different to some people than the typical fan-like white noise that most humidifiers make). This might dissuade some people from using the HEV685W in a bedroom (depending on what kind of sleeper they are).

Overall, this Levoit model is an exceptional humidifier, and it\u2019s the first ultrasonic model we\u2019d suggest you consider.

That means you can set a target humidity, and the machine will turn itself on and off to keep the air at that level.

Although the tank itself is slightly larger than the one on the HCM-350, the fill hole is actually smaller, which means that people with larger hands might have to squeeze their hands tight to get them in there to scrub. There\u2019s also one narrow cylinder/pipe within the cylindrical tank that can be difficult to clean around, and some parts of the HUL430B are not dishwasher-safe.

The fill hole of the HCM-350\u2019s tank is large enough for almost anyone to reach inside to scrub it. And its tank and water tray are dishwasher-safe (top rack only, no detergent). This is how it should be. Yet the HCM-350 stands in stark contrast to many humidifier models we\u2019ve looked at that contain electronics in the base and require you to clean them by hand.
